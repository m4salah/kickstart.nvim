  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  'tpope/vim-sleuth', -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', opts = {} },

  -- indent blankline
  { 'lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim', main = 'ibl', opts = {} },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  -- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments
  { 'folke/todo-comments.nvim', event = 'VimEnter', dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }, opts = { signs = false } },

  -- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
  -- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
  -- place them in the correct locations.

  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
  --
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
  require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
  require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
  --
  --  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
  --    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
  -- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
